# A Computer System for Pose Estimation Based on the OpenPose Library
### Summary
Pose estimation is a computer vision technique that assesses a body position. This is done
by identifying body key points in an image or a video. Pose estimation systems are divided
with respect to various characteristics, including approach type, detection dimension and
a number of people they are able to detect.
This software uses an 18-key point model based on the OpenPose library. The software
enables image loading, human pose estimation on the image, performance analysis, storing
and retrieving results and exporting data to a CSV or HTML file.
